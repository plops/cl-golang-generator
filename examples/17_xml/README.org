* Synopsis

Try to download SEC filings and parse the XML.  First I try to use
edgr and if that doesn't work try to convert xsd to golang with xgen.


* References

- github.com/plops/cl-py-generator/example/61_edgar
  - i tried it before in python but the xml documents are ~400MB and
    python a bit too slow
