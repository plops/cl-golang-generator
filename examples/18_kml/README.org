* Synopsis

I want to open KML files with satellite acquisition plans
[SATPLAN]. This is how ESA distributes information the regions where
the Sentinel-1 satellites will acquire data. 

KML is a file format based on XML. The XSD definition file is
published at [XMLXSD].


* Generate Go code to parse XML using the xgen tool


#+begin_example
curl https://developers.google.com/kml/schema/kml21.xsd -O
curl https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/4742706/S1A_MP_USER_20220715T160000_20220804T180000.kml -O
go install github.com/xuri/xgen/cmd/...@latest

~/go/bin/xgen \
  -i kml22.xsd \
  -o xmlBind -l Go

#+end_example

* Appendix
** Unrelated note on emacs with termux
I have issues with an external keyboard on the Phone. It is connected
via an USB OTG adapter. C-Space doesn't work in emacs that runs inside
a termux terminal window. This key combination performs the
set-mark-command and is important for copy and paste. For the fix
uncomment the last line (starting with ctrl-space...) in
~/.termux/termux.properties.
