* Goal

I want to load and unload go code from a running golang program.  This
should allow interactive development similar to
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/23/



* Implementation

pkg/plugin looks like the right tool but apparently it can't unload
code and it also is currently (2019 Jul) only supported on linux and
mac.

Therefore, i try dearplain/goloader.
